Analysis of population structure in R using finite and infinite Bayesian mixture models

Welcome to the Dirichlet process for otolith chemistry. This package combines processing in R with MCMC code for Bayesian estimation of Dirichlet process models in the (relatively new and open source) programming language [Julia](http://julialang.org/). Post-processing is done using (mainly) the 'ape' package in R for visualization of outputs.

Tha package can be downloaded at [downloads](https://sourceforge.net/projects/popr/files/)

Look [here](https://github.com/Philipp-Neubauer/PopR/wiki/Getting-started) for installation instructions and to get started.

Please see the wiki [pages](https://github.com/Philipp-Neubauer/PopR/wiki/_pages) for further details

Support is ongoing since developments in Julia will likely affect the functionality of the code. Please email with any issues. For Julia related issues that are non-trivial, please email the Julia [user list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-users)
